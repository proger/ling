Base case:

Naive1:	Run GC every time there is not enough space or on yield and the size of
the heap is more than 65536 words

Run: 16768

Gap1: Run GC every time there is not enough space or on yield and the total size
of allocations since last gc is greater than 8192 words

Run: 1381
Run: 1372

Gap2: Same but the constant is 4096

Run: 700
Run: 689
Run: 712

Gap3: Same but the constant is 2048

Run: 925
Run: 864
